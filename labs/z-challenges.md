# 🧪 Day 3 Challenge Pack

**Goal:** Practise what you've learned with short, focused coding challenges. Complete as many as you can.

---

## ✅ Challenge 1: Track Recent Guesses

Create a script that allows the user to enter numbers until they type `'done'`.

- At the end, print how many valid numbers they entered
- If they entered at least 3, print the **last three** numbers
- If fewer than 3, print all of them

🧠 _Use:_ `input()`, `while` loop, `.append()`, `len()`, slicing

---

## ✅ Challenge 2: Signal Range Checker

Prompt the user to enter signal strengths (as floats) until they type `'done'`.

- After each input, tell them whether it is:

  - "too low" (< 2.5)
  - "in range" (2.5–4.0)
  - "too high" (> 4.0)

- At the end, print a count of how many readings were in each category

🧠 _Use:_ `if/elif/else`, counters, numeric comparisons

---

## ✅ Challenge 3: Temperature Conversion Table

Create a list of Celsius values (e.g. `[0, 10, 20, 30, 40]`).

- Convert each one to Fahrenheit using a function
- Write the output to a CSV file with three columns:

  - Celsius, Fahrenheit, Label (e.g. “cold”, “warm”, “hot”)

🧠 _Use:_ functions, tuples, `csv.writer`, `if` labels

---

## ✅ Challenge 4: Timeline Builder

Build a small schedule planner.

- Ask the user to enter `event` and `time` pairs
- Store each as a tuple in a list
- Sort the list by time
- Print the full schedule in order

🧠 _Use:_ `input()`, `.split()`, list of tuples, `sorted()`

---

## 🚀 Bonus: Create Your Own!

If you finish early, invent your own short challenge and try it out. Or pair up and extend one of these tasks.
